# Microfrontend's with Webpack Module Federation

Contains client-side and server-side microfrontend examples. Both examples are using Webpack Module Federation under the hood, however to achieve server-side rendering with Webpack Module Federation the server-side example uses the Next Module Federation plugin.

## Getting Started
1. Go to the host folder under the folder of the example microfrontend you choose (either `csr_example` or `ssr_example`).
2. Install project dependencies:
```
yarn install in project root
```
3. Run the microfrontend using the development server:
```
yarn dev
```
4. Go to the url specified in the terminal where the app is running.
